AgriAI
Overview

AgriAI is a lightweight, multilingual AI assistant designed for grassroots African farmers. The tool focuses on accessibility, simplicity, and practical guidance. It helps farmers get instant answers, crop advice, weather insights, and translation into their local language. Our goal is to support mass adoption by delivering technology that works for real farmers in real environments.

Problem Statement

Millions of smallholder African farmers lack access to expert advice, timely information, and language-friendly digital tools. Existing agricultural platforms are either too complex, too expensive, or available only in major languages. This leads to low productivity, avoidable crop losses, and limited access to knowledge.

Solution

AgriAI provides an intuitive chat-based assistant that farmers can use on low-data connections. Key features include:

Fast, simple crop and soil guidance

Local language translation powered by GPT and linguistics tools

Weather and risk prompts

Easy-to-access interface for non-technical users

Demo Video

Coming soon.

Live Deployment

Coming soon.

Architecture

AgriAI uses a minimal, modular structure:

Frontend: Simple web interface built for mobile and low-data usage

Backend: Node/Python service handling requests

AI Engine: GPT-based API with language translation pipeline

Extensions: Space to integrate weather APIs and soil advisory systems

Tech Stack

JavaScript / Python

GPT API

Translation and linguistics pipeline

Lightweight frontend framework (e.g., Vite, React Lite)

Node or Python backend

Installation and Setup
Prerequisites
